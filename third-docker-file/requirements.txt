# # No packages needed for a simple hello script
# # We can leave this file empty for now
# This file lists all Python packages your app needs.

# For a simple hello world, there are no dependencies, so it can remain empty.

# If later you add packages (like Flask, Requests, etc.), you would list them like this:

# flask==2.3.3
# requests==2.31.0
